(81,0)
(81,359)
(559,0)
(559,359)

total is height of 359, width of 559-81 = 478 ~= 1.33

height of 478, width of 645.  

Wii can only output 640x480 pixels...means it should be natively 4:3 ratio
but for some reason

as match continues, can learn more examples of what 0 is 

for falcon ditto, we want to crop from 0 to 359 vertically, 81 to 560 horizontally

what to work on next:
character
derivative
average character stock length?
fixing boundary issues
finding start of match programmatically
display how many stocks you win by - done
figure out ports

go symbol is 234 x 74 from roki's

in 480 x 640, top left should appear somewhere around 
x = 219, v = 298 with a length of 154 and height of around 75 
bottom right: 373, 259

problem:  right now i assume match ends if both percents are missing.  therer is edge case where this can happen and match doesn't end
go changes sizes...

can grab pink falcon from falcon ditto at x=103,v=363 down to x=126,v=386
blue falcon from falcon ditto at x=177,363 to x = 200,v=389
